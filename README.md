Hello!

You've probably landed here because of my involvement in one open source community or another.

My name is Christoph Blecker, and I'm a senior technical leader and architect with deep expertise in cloud-native infrastructure, site reliability engineering, and open source governance. I specialize in designing, scaling, and operating resilient platforms, with a strong focus on reliability, performance, and real-world impact.

My day job is at [Red Hat], where I lead architectural strategy for hybrid cloud management, helping shape the technical direction of our managed services portfolio. Previously, I led Red Hat’s global SRE organization, providing hands-on technical leadership, incident management, and mentorship across distributed teams supporting our managed Kubernetes offerings.

I'm a maintainer of the [Kubernetes] project, and currently serve on the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation Governing Board] as the elected maintainer representative for the Kubernetes community. In this role, I advocate for maintainers, contribute to foundation-wide governance, and help guide strategic decisions that impact the cloud-native landscape. I'm also an emertius member of the [Kubernetes Steering Committee], as well as a previous Technical Lead for the [Contributor Experience Special Interest Group].

I’m an active [public speaker], open source contributor, and mentor—passionate about building strong engineering cultures, growing community leadership, and bridging the gap between deep technical work and long-term strategic goals. If I'm not reviewing PRs, I'm probably walking my dog.
