Hello!

You've probably landed here because of my involvement in one open source community or another. I'm an SRE on Red Hat's [OpenShift] team and a contributor and maintainer of the [Kubernetes] project.

I'm a member of the [Kubernetes Steering Committee], a Technical Lead for the [Contributor Experience Special Interest Group], and involved in a number of other SIGs including Testing, Architecture, and Release. If I'm not reviewing PRs, I'm probably walking my dog.
